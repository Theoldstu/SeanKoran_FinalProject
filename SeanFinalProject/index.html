	<h1>Pump The Beat</h1>
    <h3>Popular music in America has seen a trend in songs following a certain formula.  Many of these songs have similar characteristics, slightly different melodies, closely copied beats, and simple subject matter geared towards the average listener.  I will first look at the state of popular music in America today.  The corporations, record labels, and platforms controlling it.  And also ask the questions, should we demand more as a consumer?  Is this trend good for preeminently society, but also art?</h3>
